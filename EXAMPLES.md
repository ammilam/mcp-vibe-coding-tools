```

```
Search for all files containing 'TODO' in their name
```

## CLI & Process Management

### Running Commands

```

```

```
Execute the command: ls -la src/
```

### Environment Variables

```
What's the value of the PATH environment variable?
```

```
Show me all environment variables
```

### Finding Commands

```
Where is Python installed on this system?
```

## Git Operations

### Repository Status

```
What's the current git status?
```

```
Show me the last 10 commits
```

### Making Changes

```
Create a new branch called feature/new-ui
```

```
Commit all changes with the message "Add new UI components"
```

```
Push the current branch to origin
```

### Viewing History

```
Show me the diff for src/index.ts
```

```
What changed in the last commit?
```

### Branch Management

```
List all branches
```

```
Switch to the main branch
```

```
Delete the old-feature branch
```

## Web Scraping

### Fetching Pages

```
Fetch the content from https://news.ycombinator.com
```

```
Download the HTML from https://example.com
```

### Parsing HTML

```
Extract all the links from the fetched page
```

```
Find all h2 headings in the HTML
```

```
Get all image URLs from the page
```

## Node.js Development

### Package Management

```
Install express and cors as dependencies
```

```
Install typescript and @types/node as dev dependencies
```

```
Check for outdated packages
```

### Running Scripts

```
Run the build script
```

```
Execute npm test
```

### Project Setup

```
Initialize a new npm project called my-awesome-app
```

```
Show me the current package.json
```

## Python Development

### Virtual Environments

```
Create a Python virtual environment
```

```
Create a venv called .venv
```

### Package Management

```
Install requests and beautifulsoup4
```

```
Install packages from requirements.txt
```

```
Generate a requirements.txt file
```

### Running Scripts

```
Run the script main.py
```

```
Execute app.py with arguments --port 8000
```

## Testing & Building

### Running Tests

```
Run all tests
```

```
Run tests with coverage
```

```
Run only the tests in src/utils
```

### Building Projects

```
Build the project
```

```
Run the build command with production settings
```

### Development Server

```
Start the dev server in the background
```

### Code Quality

```
Lint the code
```

```
Lint and automatically fix issues
```

## Advanced Workflows

### Full Development Workflow

```
1. Check git status
2. Create a new branch called feature/api-integration
3. Install axios as a dependency
4. Run the tests
5. If tests pass, commit all changes with message "Add API integration"
6. Push to origin
```

### Project Analysis

```
1. Read the package.json
2. Check for outdated dependencies
3. List all TypeScript files
4. Run the linter
```

### Web Scraping Workflow

```
1. Fetch https://example.com/api/data
2. Parse the JSON response
3. Write the data to data/output.json
```

### Release Preparation

```
1. Run all tests
2. Build the project
3. Check git status
4. Create a commit with message "Release v1.0.0"
5. Create a git tag v1.0.0
6. Push to origin with tags
```

## Tips & Best Practices

### Working with Multiple Files

```
Read all files in the src directory and show me their structure
```

### Safe Operations

```
Show me what would be committed before I actually commit
```

### Iterative Development

```
1. Show me the current code in src/app.ts
2. Now update it to add error handling
3. Run the tests to verify it works
4. Commit the changes if tests pass
```

### Environment-Specific Operations

```
Check if we're in a git repository before trying git operations
```

### Error Handling

```
Try to install the package, and if it fails, show me the error details
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found

```
Where is the python3 command?
```

### Permission Issues

```
Check the file permissions for src/config.json
```

### Path Issues

```
What's the current working directory?
```

### Dependency Conflicts

```
Show me the package.json dependencies and check for conflicts
```
